# Midi-animator

This project was started after watching [Look Mum No Computer's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKm0rwuQr3s) where he controls the backlights of his Gameboy Megamachine with Midi. This tool allows you to draw animations and export them to midi.

The project is hosted over at https://midi-animator.pascalbouwhuis.nl.

##Todo
Currently the tool is configured to only work for LMNC's machine. If enough people want this for their own contraptions, I will add a config panel to change the width, height, midi channel and note mappings.
